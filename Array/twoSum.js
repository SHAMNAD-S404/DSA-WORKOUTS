//?  Two Sum: Write a function to find two numbers in an array that add up to a given target.

//* Time Complexity: O(n), where nnn is the number of elements in the array. The algorithm
//* iterates through the array once, and each lookup and insertion operation in the hash map (object) takes average O(1) time.

//* Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is primarily determined by 
//* the space used by the hash map.
